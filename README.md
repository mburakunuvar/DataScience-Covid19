## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No additional libraries are required to run the code, below are the list of packages to be imported :

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Note : All of packages above are already Anaconda distribution of Python but might require installation for Miniconda or other Python Development Environments


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in analyzing Covid-19 Data

1. "Are governments precautions really useful in preventing the Covid-19?"
2. "Are older people more vulnerable to the coronavirus disease?"
3. "Which countries are the ones with most frequent number of casesÂ ?"


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I've had some time to play with some Python packages such as pandas and matplotlib. There's only 1 notebook called `covid19_data_analysis`
which includes the flow on how i gathered, cleaned and analyzed data. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. Results and clear conclusions are not included as part of this notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mburakunuvar/a-quick-look-at-covid-19-74a6e111df41).

## Data Sources:<a name="data"></a>

**Version 1. [Datahub - Novel Coronavirus 2019](https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#readme) :** Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) time series listing confirmed cases, reported deaths and reported recoveries. Data is disaggregated by country (and sometimes subregion).

**Version 2. [Kaggle - Novel Coronavirus 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset?select=COVID19_open_line_list.csv) :** In addition to the one above, this dataset has daily level information including ages and countries
